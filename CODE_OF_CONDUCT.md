# RedisLens Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

RedisLens is built by people who care about creating a welcoming, inclusive, and
productive open-source community. This code of conduct outlines the standards we
hold ourselves and all participants to.

## Expected Behavior

  that helps others improve, and assume good intentions.
- **Welcome newcomers.** Help new contributors get oriented. Answer questions
  patiently and point people toward relevant documentation.
- **Focus on the project.** Keep discussions on topic and centered on what is
  best for the RedisLens community and its users.
- **Collaborate openly.** Share knowledge, communicate clearly, and work toward
  consensus when disagreements arise.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.
- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory language.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Sustained disruption of discussions or project activities.

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this code of conduct, please
report it by emailing [conduct@redislens.dev](mailto:conduct@redislens.dev). All
reports will be handled confidentially.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will review every report promptly and take appropriate action, which
may include a warning, temporary ban, or permanent removal from the project. The
goal is always to resolve issues fairly and restore a healthy environment.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all RedisLens project spaces, including GitHub
repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, and any other channels
managed by the project.
